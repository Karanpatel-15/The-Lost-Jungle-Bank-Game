# ðŸŽ® The-Lost-Jungle-Bank-Game

Coding a project at times might seem like the hardest aspect of a project. However, I have found establishing the requirements and project design are equally as difficult. <br>

In the case of this project, our requirements were laid out by two 2nd-grade students at the local elementary school. Our task was to implement a game in JS that meet all the requirements of the students such as game mechanics, obstacles, and characters. <br>
